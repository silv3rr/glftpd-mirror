  Glftpd Questions and Answers
`------------------------------'

Q)  How do I upgrade glftpd?
A)  Follow instructions in the UPGRADING file. If you're upgrading more than
    one version up, it is recommended that you upgrade one version at a time,
    log in to the site and globally change one of your users' attributes to
    make glftpd re-write all userfiles (and do some conversions if necessary).
    For example, log in as siteop and do "site change * max_ulspeed 0" after
    each version upgrade.

Q)  How do I restart glftpd?
A)  Log off and back on. Glftpd reads its config file each time a user logs on.
    If someone tells you to HUP inetd, tell him he's an idiot and doesn't
    understand how glftpd works. HUPping inetd is needed after making changes
    to inetd.conf, not glftpd.conf.

Q)  Can I turn IP checking off?
A)  To turn it off for all existing users and any future users, type this at
    the shell:
    cd /glftpd/ftp-data/users; ls|while read usr; do echo "IP *@*" >>$usr; done
    Change the path if you installed glftpd elsewhere.

Q)  I want to create a symlink in /incoming that points to another partition.  
    The link is there, but users are not able to change directory to it. 
A)  For symlinks to work right, the target of the symlink must be in the glftpd
    root path.
    It is best to just mount the partition under /glftpd/site.
    A symlink from /glftpd/site to /glftpd/bleh will have to be without the
    rootpath, so it will go from /site to /bleh.
    The above will only work if users' homedir is set to /. Users can't access
    anything outside of their homedir, so if it is /site, they won't be able to
    jump to /glftpd/bleh.
    Otherwise, your links need to start with . and they can't have the
    rootpath or homedir in them.  Examples:
    ln -s ./incoming/mydir mydirshortcut
    ln -s ../archive/games games
    ln -s /incoming/uploads uploads
    
    The reason for this limitation is for security purposes. When a user logs
    in, he is "chrooted" to /glftpd (or whatever the rootpath is), so it is
    physically impossible to access anything outside. This prohibits any user
    logged in from browsing outside the glftpd root directory. If you're
    familiar w/ wu-ftpd and telnet, normal users are permitted to browse
    anywhere permissions permit. This is not a desired feature for this server,
    and we feel the "cost" is worth the security.

    You can also use the mount -bind command but this is for use with the
    latest mount version on linux in 2.4+ kernels. This lets you mount a drive
    to more than one mountpoint. Another option is to export a directory
    outside of /glftpd via nfs and then nfs-mount it inside - but this will
    slow things down.

Q)  I want to setup a more "open" site. I would like one login/password for a
    multitude of users. Essentially I want an "anonymous" style login.
A)  Create the account w/ the password you desire, and set IP0 to *@*
    (site addip <user> <pass> *@*).
    If you want to use an email for password, or any password, see glftpd.docs
    for syntax on the site chpass command.
    You also need to set the number of simultaneous logins to what you need it
    to be.  (site CHANGE <user> NUM_LOGINS 0) 0=infinite
    (Update) In 1.15.6+ there is a new flag (8)..which is for anon users.
    e.g.:	site adduser mp3 mp3 *@*
		site chpass mp3 * for any password
		site chpass mp3 @ for email-style passwords

    Then edit the ratio and credits. When the mp3 user logs in, the mp3
    account is read in as a template, so each mp3 user that logs in will have
    a fresh ratio and credits.

Q)  GREAT! That works just like I need it to. Now I want to add a "set ratio
    per login" so each individual that logs in will start w/ a fresh ratio.
A)  Only possible in 1.15.6 and above. Read above.

Q)  How do users change their own password?
A)  site PASSWD <password>; and as always READ glftpd.docs

Q)  Where can I get a good FAQ on glFTPD?
A)  *shrug* You're reading it.

Q)  Where can I always find the absolute positively latest version of glFTPD?
A)  http://www.glftpd.eu will contain latest version, however check in #glftpd 
    on EFNet too.

Q)  Where can I get scripts, and utilities for glFTPD?
A)  Check the web site: http://www.glftpd.eu

Q)  When I create a directory for users to upload to, what permissions do I
    need to give it?
A)  777.  chmod 777 <directory>, and add the path to the rights section
    of /etc/glftpd.conf. `man chmod` for more information.

    All directories you want users to access through glftpd should be 755,
    and incoming dirs (dirs users upload to) should be 777.

Q)  How do I make dated directories automatically?
A)  Crontab /glftpd/bin/dated.sh to run at or right after midnight.

Q)  What is a NUKE?
A)  When a user uploads a file and a person with the nuke flag sees reason
    for it to not be on the site, they can NUKE it. This typically renames
    the directory. The rename format is definable in the config file.
    Nuking is designed to take away the credits and transfer statistics for
    the files from people that uploaded them.

Q)  How do I disable DUPE checking?
A1) Add nodupecheck /path/to/be/excluded/from/dupechecking to your config file.
A2) Change your dupe_check argument to 0 in config file to disable all paths.

Q)  Where can I get the source code?
A)  Nowhere, it is not released for several reasons.
    1. Evil hackers could find exploits easier and not report them.
    2. Wanna-be 'coders' would start many variants of glftpd that they would
       claim are their own and they probably wouldn't share any work they do.
    There are several people with access to the source code; when we are
    confident that #1 is not a big issue and when we no longer care about #2,
    we will release the source code.

Q)  Does it matter what distribution of Linux I use?? 
A)  99.9% of distribution problems are user related. Users of Redhat report
    the most problems by percentage.
    Need I say more?

Q)  I have a question, but its not on this list.
A)  Read the glftpd.docs and see if you can find an answer.
    If you have a good question that should be here, contact us in #glftpd on
    EFNet or through web pages.

Q)  Where can I find a Windows version of glFTPD?
A)  See next question.

Q)  When will a Windows version be released?
A)  See previous question.

Q)  What does the "gl" in glFTPD stand for?
A)  -The creator's answer: He keeps telling us it's because he's "Good Looking".
    -More likely answer: His nick is GreyLine.

Q)  I get "site: command not found"? What am I doing wrong?
A)  Are you logged INTO the ftpd?  Most likely not. (moron)
    Type "ftp localhost portnumber", log in, try it again.

Q)  When trying to use a site command, I get "?Invalid command". Why?
A)  Some old ftp clients don't support site commands directly.
    Try "quote site bleh" instead.

Q)  How do I edit the dirlog?
A)  Make a dirlog editor, the source was released to use as a base.
    (Update) Thanks to evilution there are several utils to manipulate dirlog,
    look in /glftpd/bin/sources.

Q)  Where can I find a list of the changes that have occurred to glFTPD
    throughout its life?
A)  In the CHANGELOG included in the distribution package.

Q)  How do install Linux ?
A)  *SMACK*

Q)  I have this GREAT idea for glFTPD.  How do I go about communicating
    this idea back to the author(s)?
A1) Create an issue on the github page (link available at the glFTPD website)
A2) Drop in #glftpd on EFNet and talk to an op.

Q)  How can I have more then 1 simultaneous login?
A)  site CHANGE <user> NUM_LOGINS 0 (0=infinite).
    READ the included glftpd.docs

Q)  How can I get the most out of my glFTPD experience?
A)  READ glftpd.docs

Q)  How can i keep any user from showing up in the user list and in the
    stats commands (wkup, aldn, etc)?
A)  Chown 99.99 userfile (located in /glftpd/ftp-data/users).

Q)  If i have users on my shell but i dont want them browsing my ftp site,
    what do I do to disallow them from doing this??
A)  You can install glftpd into /jail/glftpd, chmod jail to 700 and chmod
    glftpd 755 and leave everything else default.

Q)  How do I give someone unlimited credits??
A)  Site change user ratio 0... can you guess whats coming next??
    This is all in the glftpd.docs file.

Q)  Hey I can't do site users?? This must be a bug??
A)  You need the +H flag. Try "site flags" for help, or rtfm.

Q)  What do all the dirs mean?? I see them but dont understand there purpose.
A)  /glftpd
	- bin (This is where all the bins are stored for the server)
	- etc (This is where the passwd and group files are... don't worry about
	       the passwd- and group- they are only backups)
	- dev (This is where null and zero are stored. Some scripts need them)
	- lib (This is where all the libs are stored for all the external
	       programs executed under glftpd.)
	- ftp-data (This is where all the data for the server is stored)
		- byefiles (This is where the user.bye files are stored. When a
		  user is deleted, you can put the reason for the sudden
		  departure of their account in there to be shown next time
		  they try to log in)
		- help (This is where the help files are stored. You can change
		  how they look, they're just regular text files)
		- logs (This is where the log files are. Usefull for siteops)
		- misc (This is where some misc text files are kept, like
		  welcome message, goodbye, etc. This is where you put most of
		  your cookies to be displayed when users login, etc.)
		- text (This is where all of the texts are stored. Go in and
		  read them to get an idea what their purpose is)
		- users (This is where the user data is stored. Sometimes it's
		  easier to edit those files then to do it from the ftpd, but
		  be warned you could fuck it up and hose the account)

Q)  If i want to put glftpd on port 21 how do I do this?? I have tried and it
    doesnt seem to work.
A)  The standard ftp client under linux needs the line "ftp 21/tcp" in the
    /etc/services file. Other clients should work fine. If you need the
    standard ftp client to work, just keep your old "ftp 21" line in addition
    to the "glftpd 21/tcp" line in the services file.

Q)  I get a 220 Server Error: (SHMGET) Failed!, how do I fix this?
A)  When you change the max_users you need to kill off all glftpd sessions
    and stop running gl_spy.
    To solve this, type: ipcs
     ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
     key        shmid     owner     perms     bytes     nattch    status      
     0x00000000 0         nobody    600       46084     11        dest        
     0x0000dead 2945      root      644       15840     0               locked
     ------ Semaphore Arrays --------
     key       semid     owner     perms     nsems     status      
     ------ Message Queues --------
     key       msqid     owner     perms     used-bytes  messages    
     0x00000000 0         root      700       0
     
     For linux type: ipcrm shm shmid (In this example, shmid is 2945)
     For FBSD type: ipcrm -m shmid
Ab)  Make sure your kernel isn't screwing with shared memory.  Some "secure"
     kernels (in new Mandrake linux distributions) are doing this.

Q)  My rootpath is / and now help doesnt work anymore, please help!!
A)  /glftpd/ftp-data/help/site.help needs to be edited to reflect the root_path
    change.

Q)  I get "200 username not unique" how can i fix this??
A)  You have an entry in your /glftpd/etc/passwd file with the same user name.

Q)  My time in glftpd isn't right, how do i fix this??
A)  locate localtime ; cp /pathto/localtime /glftpd/etc
    If that doesn't work, try copying it to /glftpd/usr/lib/zoneinfo or
    /glftpd/usr/share/zoneinfo). Obviously, you need to create /glftpd/usr
    and the share/lib dirs under it.

Q)  My time in gl_spy isn't right, how do i fix this??
A1) Don't use redhat
A2) Locate localtime ; cp /pathto/localtime /usr/lib/zoneinfo

Q)  What if I want to give a user a 3:1 ratio??
A)  You can't, currently glftpd only support 1:x ratio.

Q)  Site alup and other stat commands don't show the header/footer files
    for all sections besides the default one.  How do I fix it?
A)  You need to copy the head/foot/body files to SECTIONNAMEfile.head, etc.
    For example, if you add a section called ISO, you need to do this:
    cp alup.head ISOalup.head; cp alup.body ISOalup.body, etc, for every stats
    file in the text dir.

Q)  I deleted one of my logs from ftp-data/logs and glftpd doesn't re-create it,
    what do I do?
A)  Touch file.log (make sure you are root when you do this).

Q)  How do I prevent subdirectories of a directory from being shown in site new?
A)  Change your dirlog entry in config file to have a / at the end of the path.
    For example: dirlog /site/incoming/*/ *
    The above will log /site/incoming/Newdir but not /site/incoming/Newdir/dir1

Q)  Does glftpd support upload resume??
A)  Yes, but: 
              1) The user must have resume permissions for that file (set in
                 glftpd.conf)
              2) The uploader must be the file's owner
              3) The file's permissions need to be 644 (default in glftpd) 
    Keep in mind that you might need to disable post_check (zipscript) in the
    directory where you want resume to work - or modify it not to delete
    incomplete files.
    Another problem people encounter is the file_names setting in glftpd.conf,
    which renames files people upload. This confuses many clients into thinking
    the file doesn't exist yet, and they try to upload it from the beginning,
    but when glftpd renames the new file name, it results in overwriting of
    the old file (unless the user has no overwrite permission, which results
    in an error).

Q)  I get "200- Lock on password file failed." when trying to add a user
A)  cd /glftpd/etc; cp passwd bleh; rm -f passwd; mv bleh passwd

Q)  My glftpd won't start and my syslog says "Chroot failed." What's wrong?
A1) You aren't running glftpd as root (the default line for inetd.conf runs
    it as root, so you must have changed it)
A2) Your rootpath is incorrect in glftpd.conf.

Q)  How do I make symlinks on my site look like regular directories?
A)  Add the -L option to your lslong options in glftpd.conf. exmp: lslong -alL

Q)  How do I ban a specific IP from my site?
A1) Ban it in your firewall.
A2) If you're using tcpd in inetd.conf to call glftpd (this is default),
    ban the IP in /etc/hosts.allow. Exmp: glftpd: ALL except 1.2.3.4
    For more info, try "man tcpd" or "man 5 hosts_access" on slackware
A3) To ban that IP for only specific user(s), add it to a file, with a ! in
    front, and add that file as IP0 of that user. See addip syntax in docs.

Q)  I can connect to newly installed glftpd from localhost, but not from
    outside.
A1) Add *@* to the user you're trying to connect as (yes, if your IP is not
    added to any users, you won't even get a login prompt).
A2) Add "glftpd: ALL" to /etc/hosts.allow (unless you didn't use tcpd in
    inetd.conf)
A3) Make sure you're not using a firewall of some kind.
A4) If you're using "valid_ip" in config file, comment it out and try again.
A5) Check glftpd logs and system logs (make sure your system logs errors)

Q)  I make changes to glftpd.conf but they don't take effect when I re-login.
A)  Are you modifying the correct config file? By default it's /etc/glftpd.conf,
    not /glftpd/etc/glftpd.conf or /glftpd/glftpd.conf.

Q)  How do I make new users start at a specific UID, like 10000?
A)  Edit /glftpd/etc/passwd and change last user's UID to 10000.

Q)  Can I disallow users to see or enter a directory but allow them to enter
    its subdirectory via a symlink?
A)  Yes. Add these lines to your config file:
    privpath /site/hiddendir/yourdir *
    privpath /site/hiddendir =NoOne
    (make sure you don't have a group called NoOne)
    Then go to /glftpd/site and make a symlink, ie.
    ln -s ./hiddendir/yourdir link_to_yourdir
    Note: once you cd to link_to_yourdir, you can't do "cd .." because ".." is
    protected. To get out, either "cd /" or make a symlink in yourdir that
    points to "../.." . Also, some clients will automatically cd to the proper
    parent when you are in a symlink-directory, but only if they know it's a
    symlink. If you use ls -L (or if your lslong setting in config file
    has the L in its options), the symlink appears as normal directory so the
    client thinks it's just a regular directory.
   
Q)  Can I restrict one command but not others in a case of bundled commands,
    like "laston" and "onel", which are both controlled by the "-info" setting?
A)  Yes. Here is what you need to add to restrict "site laston" to siteops only,
    without affecting other commands controlled by "-info", to glftpd.conf:
    site_cmd laston is laston
    custom-laston 1
    
Q)  Why do my new users start in / instead of /site when they log in.
A)  Are you missing the HOMEDIR line from your default.user file? Don't edit
    default.* files with useredit.

Q)  How do I get gl_spy to use color?
A)  Run it in console, or if you have SecureCRT, set terminal to Linux, font
    to vt100, and on the linux box set TERM to crt (TERM=crt in bash)

Q)  Why does glftpd only recognize GIDs that are multiple of 100? Why do GIDs
    seem to increase by themselves, yet glftpd still displays the same one?
A)  Glftpd uses GID to store the number of times a file was downloaded (it
    stops counting at 99). So, if a file's GID is 428, it means the real GID is
    400 and the file was downloaded 28 times. This will increase each time the
    file was downloaded until it reaches 499. The number of times the file was
    downloaded is displayed in long directory listing (ls -l) if you have color
    turned on (so as not to interfere with windows clients, which require color
    to be off).

Q)  Can I "unbind" one of the bundled site commands so I can have different
    permission for it than for the rest?
A)  No, but there is a work-around. For example, to allow everyone to execute
    stat commands (wkup, daydn, etc) but only allow siteops to execute site
    traffic, do this:
     1. Add a custom command traffic: "site_cmd traffic is traffic"
     2. Add permissions for your new command: "custom-traffic 1" (this will only
        allow siteops to execute site traffic)
     3. Your -stats permissions should be "*" to allow everyone to use them.
    If you do it the other way around, giving "site traffic" * access and
    "-stats 1", it will not work because site traffic now uses 2 sets of
    permissions, one with the custom-traffic setting, and the other one with
    the -stats setting; user has to pass both to be able to execute the command.

Q)  Does glftpd run stand-alone, without inetd?
A)  No, you need inetd, xinetd, or some other program that works in a similar
    fashion. You need to run glftpd as root, anyway, so why not use inetd?

Q)  Will glftpd support using system passwd file (/etc/passwd)?
A)  No. Glftpd needs a userfile for each user; normal unix users don't have
    any such thing, so you would have to generate a userfile for every person
    even if glftpd supported it. It's just as easy to write a script that
    will add the user to glftpd (by either modifying /glftpd/etc/passwd and
    creating the userfile in ftp-data/users, or logging into glftpd and using
    site commands).

Q)  Does glftpd support /etc/shadow?
A)  Shadow is simply the same thing as passwd but only readable by root.
    Glftpd's passwd file can be made 600 already, so you could say glftpd always
    supported it. For more info see the question above.

Q)  What does the multiplier in 'site nuke' do?
A)  Multiplier is a penalty measure. If it is 0, the user doesn't lose any
    credits for the stuff being nuked. If it is 1, user only loses the
    amount of credits he gained by uploading the files (which is calculated
    by multiplying total size of file by his/her ratio). If multiplier is more
    than 1, the user loses the credits he/she gained by uploading, PLUS some
    extra credits. The formula is this: size * ratio + size * (multiplier - 1).
    This way, multiplier of 2 causes user to lose size * ratio + size * 1,
    so the additional penalty in this case is the size of nuked files. If the
    multiplier is 3, user loses size * ratio + size * 2, etc.

Q)  Listing directories through glftpd on my nfs/samba mounted drives, or in
    directories with tons of subdirectories in them, takes a very long time,
    but doing the same from the shell is very fast. What's wrong?
A)  Disable your use_dir_size option for those directories or completely.

Q) I think I found a bug, where do I report it?
A) First you should CHECK if it really is a bug and not a user or configuration
   error (this happens a lot). If you are convinced its a bug you should go to
   #glftpd@EFnet and shout out or report it on the github page.

Q) I am running 2 glftpd deamons and one of them always gives errors when I am
   trying to do a transfer or a listing.
A) If you are running more then one daemon you should always have atleast 1 port
   between them!

Q) My botscript is not working.
A) Do you have {glftpd-root}/bin/sh, and is it working?

Q) I turned off oneliners in the config and now REST or some other commands do not work.
A) When oneliners are turned off but the welcome.msg contains the %ONEL super cookie it 
   will display an error that oneliners are turned off. But because the cookie does not 
   know if there will be more lines it does not supply the multiline indicator and some 
   ftp clients might then not read the returning information properly. 
   To fix this you need to remove the %ONEL cookie from your welcome.msg file.
