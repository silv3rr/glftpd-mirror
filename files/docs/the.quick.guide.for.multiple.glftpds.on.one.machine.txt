Ok so u wanna run more than 1 glftpd server on a single machine ?
and you'r wondering how might you do it ?

if you answered yes to both of these questions you'r reading the right (fucking) manual...

The 2nd glftpd server must differ from the first one by at least three things:
a) ipc_key - what is that ? (i'd tell you to RTFM but u'r already reading one so... ill just quote)
	"....
	Glftpd uses shared memory, so it needs to use an ipc_key.  The default
	key that glftpd uses is "0x0000DEAD".  If you want to run another
	glftpd server, you need to define a different key for it in its own
	config file.  The key can be any 8-digit hexadecimal string, like:
	0x01234567, 0xDEADBABE, 0xBEEFBABE, 0xBADC0FEE, etc.

	If you're using ftpwho.c, it's ipc key will also need to be modified.
	..."

yup that came from glftpd.docs
in plain english, you gotta have two different ipc keys, one is for the first glftpd
(if not set default = 0x0000DEAD) and one for the second one, 
we'll use 0xBADC0FEE for this example.

b) the glftpd port.

c) a new definition in your inetd/xinetd for each server


of course, the second server can share the user database, or not.
it can also share the /site data, a part of it, or not.
it can share the binaries in /glftpd/bin, or not.
etc...
but it cannot share the glftpd.conf, so u'll have to copy/write a new one for the second server.

I'll show an example of 2 servers on one machine with few configurations, i think its the best way 
to explain howto install them:

.--------------------------------------------------------------.
| The Example: a server with the same userdb, datapath (/site) |
|              and everything, just a different port and conf. |
|______________________________________________________________|

    .-----------------------------------------
    | ....glftpd #1....
    | port:     8000
    | dir:      /glftpd
    | conf:     /etc/glftpd.conf
    | datapath: /ftp-data (in /glftpd)
    | pwd_path: /etc/passwd (in /glftpd)
    | grp_path: /etc/group (in /glftpd)
    |_____________________________________________


    .-----------------------------------------
    | ....glftpd #2....
    | port:     9000
    | dir:      /glftpd
    | conf:     /etc/glftpd2.conf
    | datapath: /ftp-data (in /glftpd)
    | pwd_path: /etc/passwd (in /glftpd)
    | grp_path: /etc/group (in /glftpd)
    |_____________________________________________

--== All your config ==--

ok first, cp /etc/glftpd.conf /etc/glftpd2.conf
then edit /etc/glftpd.conf
add this line to the file:
ipc_key 0xBADC0FEE
make the chages you want for the second server

[Note] more advacned users can write a common "glftpd.conf.common" file and then have
glftpd.conf use the include directive, same with glftpd2.conf
so that in the future changes which should apply to both servers will be edited in
glftpd.conf.common file, and changes for each server separately can be done in each
server's config


--== Are belong to inetd/xinetd ==--

edit your inetd, it should have something like this (if using tcpd..)
...
glftpd stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /glftpd/bin/glftpd -l -o -i
...
add the following line:
glftpd2 stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /glftpd/bin/glftpd -l -o -i -r /etc/glftpd2.conf

note the -r addon for glftpd2.conf

if you have xinetd, in /etc/xinetd.d, copy the glftpd file to glftpd2, and edit it
change the name to glftpd2 and add a switch -r /etc/glftpd2.conf

--== Set up us the port ==--

edit /etc/services
(go to the bottom of the file, usually...)
you should see glftpd 8000/tcp
(assuming 8000 is your current port)
now in this example we'll be adding port 9000 to glftpd2, so guess how the following line should look like:
glftpd2 9000/tcp

yup, thats it.

--== Main screen turn on ==--

Ok, all you have to do now is rehash your inetd
inetd users  -> killall -HUP inetd
xinetd users -> you'r screwed
just kidding, /etc/init.d/xinetd restart (or something similar...)

Now it should work if i havent forgotten anything :P

in case you want a completely two different servers with nothing shared (no binary no nothing...)
just install a new glftpd to another dir, say /glftpd2 (original eh ?)
and make sure it doesnt overwrite your current glftpd.conf... (just back it up)

simply add to inetd/xinetd the previous line
glftpd2 stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd /glftpd2/bin/glftpd -l -o -i -r /etc/glftpd2.conf
with the correct path to glftpd binary (you see here /\ glftpd2...)

the rest should be the same.

same goes for binary + site shared, but ftp-data passwd and group not shared, just set up the
correct directives (datapath, pwd_path, grp_path) just make sure they point to something whithin
the chrooted path (/glftpd/soemthing)

oh i almost forgot, since you've changed the ipc_key, programs which rely on it (usually C based
programs which rely on real-time communication with the server, not by connecting to the server
itself, like ftp-who and gl_spy) will not "work", they will probably work but will show the data
relevant for the original server whose ipc_key you didnt change... just recomiple them according
to the server ipc_key.

Thats all, i hope it helped you a bit and saved you some trouble in asking questions in #glftpd :)
