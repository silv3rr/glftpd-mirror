v1.17.2
Fix:    Glftpd wasn't passing the correct parameters to dupescript.  It is
        now passing just the filename as $1 and just the directory name
        (without the trailing slash) as $2, as it was supposed to.
Fix:    Site unnukes unnecessarily switched UID to 0 (root) and never switched
        it back.  I doubt anyone had any problems because of this, but now
        glftpd is a bit more secure.
Change: When you give someone wkly_allotment and this user has less credits
        than the allotment amount, he will get the credits now and not have
        to wait until the beginning of the next week.
Change: Userfile cache will now be turned off by default.  We found that it
        is greatly decreasing performance instead of increasing it.  If you
        still want to turn it on, add "use_cache 1" to your config file.
New:    Writing to userfiles is now much more secure.  Before, it was possible
        for a user with 2 connections to lose stats if one connection wrote
        over his/her user file while the second connection was in the process
        of modifying it.  Now, glftpd will create a userfile.lock when it
        reads a userfile.  If a lockfile exists, glftpd will wait until it
        disappears before making modifications.
        NOTE: If you turn user cache on, this will be turned off, because
        there is some bug that makes glftpd segfault if both are turned on.
Change: SITE SEARCH will now strip the user's homedirectory from the paths
        that it finds in dirlog (/site/blah will become /blah).
Fix:    The external nuker wasn't subtracting credits for what was nuked!
        Thanks to everyone who was using it for months or years and never
        reported this bug :).
Fix:    After an upload, the statline was not updated with the new stats (if
        the user received credits for the file) - it is now.
Fix:    The nostatdir option might not have worked correctly in some cases
        (it was using an uninitialized integer).
Fix:    For "creditcheck 1" directories, uploading resulted in 1x credit, but
        deleting resulted in 3x credit loss (assuming your ratio was 3).
Change: Nukers were able to delete any files on the site.  Now they will
        need either nuke or delete rights to be able to delete.  Everyone
        else needs delete rights to delete files (except the file's owner).
Fix:    SITE USERS didn't count deleted users in the end statistics.
Fix:    SITE PURGE will now delete the user's message file after deleting
        his/her userfile.
New:    The messaging system has been expanded. Users now have 2 mailboxes,
        inbox and trash. After reading messages, they are moved to trash.
        They can be moved back to inbox with "site msg save". They can be
        deleted from trash with "site msg purge". They can also be read
        while in trash with "site msg tread". Messages will be automatically
        deleted from trash when the user normally logs off (with QUIT).
New:    Normally, siteops were unable to change flags for other siteops, so
        the only way to do this was to edit the userfile manually.  You are
        now able to specify a master siteop by adding "master bleh" to the
        config file.  A master siteop can change flags for other siteops.
        There can only be one master siteop, all subsequent master
        definitions are ignored.
Change: SITE PURGE USER will no longer allow to purge users that have not
        been deleted first (this also fixes several security issues, like
        purging siteops when deleting them wasn't allowed).
New:    You can now use echo in dupescript and dirscript before exit 0
        (you could only use it before exit 1 until now).  Just add "#0" at
        the beginning of your echo string.
        EXAMPLE: echo -e "#0Script will exit with success.\r"
Change: The rights section of the config file (upload, dirlog, nuke, etc)
        will now be read from top to bottom instead of the other way around.
        This will make the rights check faster and similar to what practically
        all other programs use.  The first directory match will stop the
        search, so you should put the more specific directories on top and
        the least specific ones on the bottom.  Example:
        upload /site/archive/* no *
        upload /site/incoming/* yes *
        upload /site/* yes STAFF
Fix:    Site help users was fixed and updated to show all the options.
Change: Site change flags is more idiot-proof and converts lower-case
        letters to upper-case (since all flags are upper case).
Fix:    New users' password won't be stored in shared anymore memory anymore
        after someone uses the "adduser" command, so ftpwho won't show it.

v1.17.1
Fix:	SITE CHGRP removed a user from all private groups if you tried
	to remove him/her from the first private group.
Fix:    ftpwho.c was fixed to show when a user is idle (thanks HoE)
Fix:    site who and site swho had problems with idle time when you were
        using the new timezone variable.
Fix:    SITE TRAFFIC fixed to handle higher numbers of bytes for alltime
        stats (by storing kilobytes instead of bytes).
Fix:    Users who had the IDLER flag and who were idle more than their idle
        time (usually 900 seconds) could cause an infinite loop that ate all
        the CPU when their connection to the site was lost. To fix this,
        users who have the IDLER flag will get their idle time set to 0 right
        after login (so it will work the same as having the EXEMPT flag and
        typing "site idle 0").
Change: Deleted users will not be listed in "site users" anymore (except when
        you type "site users deleted").
Fix:    There was a bug that, instead of starting to look at the 4th argument
        of the function settings in the config file (upload, makedir, dirlog,
        etc), it looked at the first, second, third... argument. As a
        result, if you used "*" on the PATH line, everyone would get access,
        not just users belonging to the group in the 4th argument.

v1.17.0
Fix:    SITE CHHOMEDIR didn't show the user's home directory if a new
        directory wasn't specified, like it was supposed to.
Fix:    SITE REQFILLED only worked on requests < 22 even if you set your
        site to keep a list of more than 21 requests.  It was increased to
        50 to match the maximum setting.
New:    Filled requests are now added to ftp-data/logs/request.log so that
        siteops can check if the uploads were actually requested and by whom.
        Entries are only added when someone does SITE REQFILLED # successfully.
        This log can be viewed with SITE REQLOG [#], the optional number
        being the number of days ago to show.
        Example: SITE REQLOG 5 (will show requests filled in the last 5 days).
Fix:    SITE FLAGS user crapped out on you if you were gadmin trying to view
        someone who wasn't in your group.
Change: Due to a conflict of flags and parameters passed to custom commands,
        this feature has been removed (see below).
Change: Most of site commands are now configurable, that is, you can specify
        who is allowed to execute them.  You will need all 40+ commands in
        your config file, the details on how to do this are in the docs.
Change: Custom commands can be bound to flags/groups just like the commands
        mentioned above.
New:    Dirscript.  It is similar to dupescript, but it is ran before a
        directory is made.  If it returns 1, the directory will not be made.
        $1 and $2 are directory name and path in which the user is trying to
        make it, respectively.  To enable dirscript, add "pre_dir_check
        /bin/dirscript" into your config file.  The default dirscript checks
        if $1 already exists in yesterday's dated directory.
Change: People with the +7 flag are now unable to add to/remove from private
        groups (this is configurable with the -chgrp-priv variable)
New:    Userfiles contain an additional field, TIMEFRAME, with 2 arguments,
        the hour from which to allow logins and the hour when logins from
        this user will begin being rejected.  To change it use SITE CHANGE
        <username> timeframe # #.
Change: The %[%s]IE cookie was changed to show timeframe.
New:    New variable for the config file, timezone.  Use this if your glftpd
        is getting the wrong time from the operating system (usually because
        redhat sucks).  Exmp: "timezone -4" will make glftpd shift the time
        it receives from the OS 4 hours back.
Change: The code to do stats (weektops, etc) was re-designed to use linked
        lists instead of static arrays - glftpd should use a little less
        memory now.
New:    Stat sections can now have different ratios. The default ratio is
        the one used by stat section 0. By default, other ratios are -1,
        meaning they are disabled and the default one will be used.  If you
        change ratio for a stat section, it will be used when uploading/
        nuking/etc in that stat section's directory.
        To change ratio for stat sections 1-9, use SITE CHANGE SRATIO.
Change: SITE CHPASS will now allow groupops to change password for members
        of their group by default (this of course can be disabled).
Change: "SITE CHHOMEDIR" is now "SITE CHANGE <user> homedir", this way you
        can change it for more than one user at a time.
Fix:    ftpwho.c was fixed (it was screwing up the display).
Change: The userfile format was changed, credits and ratio were removed
        from the GENERAL line and ratio has its own line now.
        You HAVE to convert your user files using the "uconv" program
        when you're upgrading if you don't want users' settings to get
        messed up.
New:    New optional variable for config file, no_ident. If you add this
        variable, glftpd will not add an ip if the user adding it doesn't
        have access and if he/she does not supply an ident. The access flags
        work the same way as for site commands.
        Example: "no_ident 1 7" will only allow siteops and useredits to add
        an ip with * for an ident. This is a good way to prevent group admins
        from adding insecure access masks to their users.
Fix:    SITE ADDUSER was made a little more "idiot-proof" :}
New:    New variable for glftpd.conf, freefile.  USAGE: freefile *.nfo *
        The above will allow everyone to download all files ending in .nfo
        without losing any credits. If you replace * with a group name, only
        users belonging to that group will not lose credits. Only one group
        per line, if you want multiple groups, add multiple freefile variables.
Change: The freedldir variable can now take a group as second argument to
        only allow a certain group to download for free from the directory.
Fix:    A minor security bug: files specified after the noretrieve variable
        could not be downloaded with "get file" but could with
        "get /site/file file".
New:    New variable for config file, no_downloads.
        USAGE: "no_downloads /site/private*" will not allow users to download
        files from directory /site/private or any of its subdirectories.
Change: SITE GROUPS modified by Jestrz to show the number of users that are
        in each of the groups.
Fix:    Gadmins are now unable to take away their own leech (assuming
        they're dumb enough to try) if they don't have the leech slot
        setting enabled.
Change: Users with leech were unable to give credits. This check was removed
        - if leechers have credits they can give them away now (provided
        they have the +G flag).

v1.16.9
New:    The default zipscript was modified to only extract file_id.diz to
        .message if .message does not exist or has 0 bytes. Now if someone
        uploads a zip that doesn't have file_id.diz, the .message file won't
        become 0 bytes.
Change: Shared memory is now initialized before banner is displayed, so you
        can access it from a script ran from banner and perhaps deny login
        if the hostname matches an entry on your black list or something.
Fix:    I forgot to remove a debug message from ls, your login.log is
        probably full of "doing ls" messages, sorry about that.
New:    SITE USERS can now take a username with an asterisk at the end to
        find all users that begin with that username.
        Example: "SITE USERS la*" will find lamer, lamuh, lazyass, etc.
Change: Nuking files uploaded by a non-existing user didn't get logged.
        It will show up as UNKNOWN now.
New:    New command, SITE TRAFFIC, shows total uploads/downloads/speeds.
Fix:    A security problem was fixed. Siteops are urged to upgrade.
        I won't disclose the details for a while so that people who don't
        upgrade right away won't get hacked (this hack is possible with
        all versions since 1.10.x.)
Change: SITE LOGINS can take an argument, number of days.  This works the
        same as with SITE UCHANGES, see changelog for v1.16.8.

v1.16.8
New:    New command, SITE CHHOMEDIR, allows siteops and people with useredit
        to change a user's homedir.  Use SITE CHHOMEDIR username to view it.
        As a security measure, this command will not work by default. To
        enable it, add "min_homedir /directory" to your config file, where
        "/directory" is the minimum directory depth a homedir can be changed
        to. Example: "min_homedir /site" would only allow users' homedir to
        be changed to /site, /site/blah..., and deny /bin, /etc, /ftp-data,...
New:    SITE MSG can now accept multiple destinations enclosed in braces.
        Example: SITE MSG { user1 user2 user3 } test message
        NOTE: Don't forget a space around each brace.
New:    Siteops can send global messages.
        Example: SITE MSG * Global message test
New:    Users can send a message to every member of their group.
        Example: SITE MSG =MyGroup hi there
        NOTE: Siteops can use this for any group.
Change: To read your messages, use SITE MSG READ instead of SITE MSG.
New:    SITE CHANGE can now accept multiple users just like site msg
        (usernames in { }, group name with = in front, or * for all)
Change: Site commands' length changed from 512 to 1024 characters.
Fix:    Directories made on FreeBSD did not have the user's primary group
        as gid.
Fix:    When post_check is disabled, glftpd should not delete an incomplete
        file when connection is lost (so that people can resume) - this might
        not have worked every time, should be fixed now.
Change: site_cmd can now be bound to user flags.
        Example: site_cmd PICT TEXT /ftp-data/misc/pict.ans 5
        (this will only allow users who have color enabled to see the picture)
        Example: site_cmd UPURGE EXEC /bin/purge.sh 17
        (this will only work for people with useredit or siteop access)
        If you don't specify flags, or specify non-existent flags, access is
        granted to all (so this is backwards compatible).
New:    SITE RENUSER <old_username> <new_username> will rename a user.
Change: SITE UNNUKE worked in a really weird way - you could unnuke dirs that
        were not nuked, etc.  Some extra code was removed and the command
        works as it should now.
Fix:    SITE NUKE and SITE UNNUKE can take {dirname} instead of dirname, this
        is helpful if you have spaces in the dirname, putting it in braces
        keeps glftpd from confusing dirname with nuke/unnuke message.  This
        did not work correctly, should be fine now.
New:    SITE UCHANGES can now accept the number of days to show.
        Example: SITE UCHANGES 3 will show sysop.log of only the last 3 days.
Fix:    Purging users who were online resulted in deletion of passwd entry
        but not of the userfile - as a result you couldn't add this user
        again until you manually deleted his user file.  Purge will now skip
        users who are logged on, you have to kick them first.
Fix:    The lslong variable in the config file did not work since glftpd
        started using an internal ls.

v1.16.7
Fix:    The last fix in 1.16.6 (deleting files when uploader loses connection)
        did not work correctly, it was fixed in a different way now.
New:    New site command, GADDUSER, will add a user and put him in a group
        Example: site gadduser IND lamer lamepass lamer@*.aol.com
Fix:    Forgot to modify reset to work with new userfile fields (groupop
        leech slots and max_ulspeed) so they did not get saved.
Fix:    The %% cookie got broken a few versions back.  Also the %x cookies
        will now print nothing (they were replaced a few versions back by
        the %[%x]x cookies).
Fix:    Deleting directories with DELE was logged to glftpd.log, but deleting
        them with RMD was not.
Change: SITE CHMOD can now only be used by siteops.
Fix:    Some groups put ^M at the beginning of line in file_id.diz, glftpd
        would not display a line like that, it will convert ^M to space now.
Fix:    max_dlspeed and max_ulspeed didn't work in 1.16.6.
New:    The stats binary was upgraded to version 3.2 (supports multiple
        stat sections now)

v1.16.6
Change: After uploading, the transfer speed is now being calculated before
        zipscript is executed - this should make it more accurate.
Change: The "SITE UMASK" command was disabled - it wasn't being used anyway.
Fix:    get -R in ncftp will now work (as well as all list commands that
        have directory name following parameters).
Fix:    *Sigh* yet another (this time final) bug in site who that I missed,
        filenames 11 characters in length had a control character at the end.
New:    Global bandwidth control (directory based). Speed settings go into
        the config file. USAGE:   speed_limit   PATH     DL_LIMIT   UP_LIMIT.
        The first directory match is the one used, so you would want
        the completely global setting (/* as PATH) at the very bottom if
        you have several speed_limit settings.
        Example: speed_limit /site/Incoming* 150000 0     # 0 = Unlimited
        NOTE: speed indicated on gl_spy or ftpwho may tend to fluctuate more
        than before.
Change: gl_spy and ftpwho during a user's transfer shows the full path to the
        file in question instead of the user's current directory. This is in
        support of the global bw feature.
New:    Memory mapping of files downloaded is now configurable.  The default
        setting for mmap_amount is 16 (used in v1.16.3+). Change it in the
        config file, the range is 1 to 50 (in megs). If you have low memory
        and your users are downloading large files, you might want to set
        this to a low number, otherwise glftpd uses up all your memory.
        Example: mmap_amount 5 (keeps files smaller than 5 megs in memory).
Change: max_speed is now max_dlspeed (in site change).
New:    max_ulspeed, controls how fast a user can upload (bytes/sec).
New:    New cookie, %[%f]I&, displays max upload speed.
Change: Site who will now hide the user altogether instead of just hiding
        the filename if the user is transferring in a hidden dir.
Change: Glftpd will not allow you to enter the ':' character in group name
        or description.
New:    New color code, !Z, which prints a generic bold.
Fix:    Connecting from localhost did not work with -B bouncer option.
New:    glftpd now supports bnc4all (detection is automatic).
Change: When server is shut down, glftpd will display /ftp-data/text/shutdown
        instead of responding with a built-in message.
Fix:    site grpren fixed and re-enabled.
Fix:    If an uploader lost connection before file was finished, that file did
        not get deleted if it was bad - should be getting deleted now.

v1.16.5
New:    Second parameter passed to dupescript (the actual upload dir, just
        like with zipscript in v1.16.4).
New:    New variable in glftpd.conf, bouncer_ip.  If you run the daemon with
        -b or -B, you MUST add the bouncer IP(s) to the config file.  You
        can add more than one IP (in case you have more than one bouncer).
        Example: bouncer_ip 1.2.3.4 10.20.30.40
Change: The -b option will now allow users to log in directly to the site if
        their IP is not on the bouncer_ip list.
New:    New user flag (+I = IDLER), it lets the person idle forever (will not
        timeout and disconnect).  Be careful with this, don't give it to
        everyone or your site will always be full, I recommend only giving
        it to a few siteops.
New:    A new change command added, comment.  Use "site change user comment
        blah" to change someone's comment to "blah". If you are a siteop or
        have useredit & do "site user bleh", file /ftp-data/text/user.comment
        will be displayed right before the user.txt file. Comments can be
        max 50 characters. The purpose of comments is to keep info about a
        user that only siteops can see, like "This is my friend, don't delete
        him - Usurper" or "Has leech for hardware contribution" etc.
        The default comment for new users is "Added by <username>".
New:    A new cookie added, "%[%s]I$", that will display the user's comment.
        Suggestion: don't use it in any files readable by normal users.
Change: GINFO restricted to users with the +H flag (group admins are exempted
        if they do GINFO for their own group).
Fix:    The Sighup tcl did not work because one dumbass (no need to mention
        names) misspelled botscript in the code :}
New:    Optional variable added to config file, shutdown. It takes one
        argument: 2, 1 or 0. If it's 1, the server will only allow siteops to
        log on.  If it's 2, it won't let anyone log on. 0 or any other
        number (or no shutdown variable) will make glftpd run as usual.
New:    When the site is full, glftpd will now display the file "sitefull"
        located in ftp-data/text instead of responding with the built-in
        message.
Fix:    Site who still showed junk if filenames were smaller than 12 chars.
Change: SITE GRPREN temporarily disabled (anyone want to try to fix it?)
Change: "SITE CHMOD" disabled by default (in the config file), comment
        it out if you want users to be able to change file permissions.
        (If you already have glftpd.conf, add "site_cmd CHMOD blah" at the
        bottom to disable this command).
Fix:    Gadmins were able to exploit a bug and get as many group slots as
        they wanted.
New:    "SITE group_slots" now can take a second parameter, the number of
        leech accounts the gadmin can add.  By default, this is -1 (disabled,
        whereas for group_slots, -1 means unlimited).  To give gadmins
        unlimited leech accounts, change the second parameter to very high #.
        Gadmins are only able to change ratio to 0 (give leech) or to 3.
        You can also use this variable to count how many leech accounts siteops
        add (make it 100 and if it becomes 90 it means the person added
        10 leech accounts - same as counting number of users a siteop added
        using the first argument of group_slots).
Change: The group slots cookie (%[%-5d]IX) changed to (%[%-5s]IX) because it
        now displays a string (both arguments of the slots setting with a
        space between them), fix your text files if you're using it.
New:    You can hide filenames in site who from non-siteops if a user is
        transferring to or from a hidden directory. Just add
        "hidedir /path* yes *" to the config file. It works the same
        as upload/makedir/delete/etc.
Change: The old useredit binary will not save userfiles correctly with 1.16.5,
        if you're using it you should wait till greyline modifies it.

v1.16.4
Fix:    There was a small bug that might have been causing glftpd not to work
        when resolve_dns was set to 0 in the config file.
Fix:    The -r /etc/other.conf option in inetd.conf fixed for those running
        multiple daemons on the same box.
New:    New variable in the config file, botscript_path.
        Default is /bin/botscript (you need to change it if you don't
        chroot the daemon)
Fix:    dirlogscanner.c did not work correctly if your rootpath was "/".
        This made the bot announce a number as owner/group of a new dir.
Fix:    FreeBSD displayed all files' group as root.  Should be ok now.
Fix:    OpenBSD was causing problems due to some files not being closed.
Fix:    External nuker did not work with rootdir set to "/".  Updated to
        version 1.5.
New:    Uploading files to directories other than "." did not work.  To fix
        this, a second parameter is passed to zipscript - the actual path
        the file is stored in.  If you do "put file.zip /incoming/file.zip",
        $1 is still "file.zip" and $2 is "/incoming".  You need to use the
        new zipscript to take advantage of this feature (or just change
        all but the "case $1 in" instance of $1 to $2/$1).
Fix:    Site who showed incorrect filename when a user was up/downloading with
        bulletproof ftp.

v1.16.3
Fix:	CWD 1 - changing to a directory as seen in 'site new'
Fix:    Samba and Uploads
New:	Under certain conditions most files sent from the site
	will be memory mapped before transferring.
New:    pwd_path variable in glftpd.conf.  eg. pwd_path /glftpd/etc/passwd
	Allows one to specify where glftpd's passwd file should be kept.
	Path is in reference to rootpath.
	Default: /etc/passwd
New:	grp_path variable in glftpd.conf.  eg. grp_path /glftpd/etc/group
	Default: /etc/group
Change: rootpath may now be specified as just '/' to disable chrooting of 
	the daemon.  (not recommended)
	Be sure to use the new grp_path and pwd_path variables if you choose
	to not chroot the daemon.
New:    glftpd no longer alters the permission set on its passwd and group file.
	chmod 400 /glftpd/etc/*   is allowed and the "daemon" should still 
	function properly with just read permissions for root.
Change: CHGRP modified by Usurper to allow up to 2 GROUPS to be named on the
	command line.
New:    DELIP can now take an argument like username@hostname instead of
        the number of the ip (useful for scripts that auto-add and delete
        users)
Change: DELIP can now take up to 10 arguments.  The arguments can be mixed
        (either a number 0-9 or username@hostname).
Fix:    ADDIP was adding junk if you specified 5 or more arguments. It can
        now take up to 10 arguments (some anti-idiot code was added, too).

v1.16.2
Fix:	Racestats (show_diz) were not displaying for the 0 byte .message files.
Fix:	SIZE command wasn't compatible with the restricted homedirs yet.
Fix:	Overwriting of files that turned out to be bad and were deleted were 
	being left in the dupefile database.
Fix:	Race condition existed if the same user (different process) tried
	to upload the same file to the same directory.  Uploaded file would
	then most likely become corrupted and be deleted via zipscript.
	Workaround in place that checks the permissions of the file before
	the transfer begins.  Overwriting of files now disabled if it see's
	that the file is in mid transfer.
Change: Overwriting of one's own files now disabled by default.
	Setting overwrite to yes in glftpd.conf allows all to overwrite any
	file in the associated directory.
Fix:	Site delip wasn't able to delete ip #0.  
	Multiple arguments on the command line left out in this
	version for 'site delip'.
New:	FAQ provided by Barkeep for those users having zipscript problems or
	those who are looking for answers as to why the daemon deletes
	all uploads.   (zipscript-faq)

v1.16.1
New:	Extra parameter added to the max_users variable in glftpd.conf.
	#max_users   10    5
	The '5' says to make room for five additional user slots that may
	only be filled in by users who are flagged exempt.  All other users
	will get the "Site full" message if more than 10 users are currently 
	logged on.
Fix:	hidden grppaths showing up in directory listings.
Fix:	site users would crash the daemon on most instances.
Fix:	gl_spy - cosmetic fixes.

v1.16.0
Change: Pid files moved into shared memory. (/ftp-data/pids can be removed)
	The system kernel must have System V IPC support compiled in!
Change: Pid structure also modified.  
	See the new included ftpwho.c for details.
New:	ipc_key variable in glftpd.conf.  See included sample.
	Needs to be changed for those running multiple sites on the same box.
New:	gl_spy utility.  Provides real-time information of all users on
	site neatly on screen.  Uses the same ncurses background and
	similar functionality as used in useredit, so you must have
	ncurses installed on your system PROPERLY.
	Available options include selectable config files, 
	increase/decrease of refresh rate, and a popup detailed 
	info box giving all pertinent information on the user selected.
	If ran as root the kick option 'k' also becomes available.
Change: EXEMPT users will now be UNABLE to login when the site if full due
	to the new daemon structure.  
	A future version MAY include a BACKDOOR for siteops to be able
	to still get in when the site is full.
Change: The check for max users on site is now done before the login prompt
	is even displayed.
Note:   Changing the config variable 'max_users' requires ALL users to be
	logged off the site as this variable controls how much memory is
	allocated.   Any other change to glftpd.conf 
	just requires you to relogin.  
	NOTE: The gl_spy utility will also have to be restarted if
	you change this variable.
Change: site who modified and shows more information on what the last command
	issued was from a user using a 5 second timer before displaying IDLE.
Change: site who: paths from transfers are now stripped to show just the 
	filenames.
Change: site whoami removed.
Change: The periodic updates on transfer speed statistics has been removed.
	All Stats are in true Real-Time.
Change: upload/nuke, etc rights have the GROUP and yes/no fields reversed 
	now so that you can add multiple groups on the same line.
Fix:	Additional checks/logging added for the use of pasv_addr.
Fix:	statfilecmd() fixed.
Fix:	logging of max_speed changes.
Fix:	NLST totally reworked.
Fix:	statline immediately updated properly after a download.
Fix:	Possible exploit in the stats bin if it was +s.
	Freebsd installation file updated since this bin should not need to 
	be ran as root anyway.  Thanks to neophyte for noticing it.. :) 
Fix:	NUKER: As a security concern, the glftpd.conf file must be root owned.
Change: Deleted dirs logged to glftpd.log as well now.  
	DELDIR: "dir" "user" "grp" "tag"
New:	%@GROUP /ftp-data/textfile   
	Display "textfile" if the user belongs in specified group.
	Main purpose is for use in welcome.msgs.
Change: %!, %=, %@ all revert back to the main parser so that any and all
	cookies can be redisplayed.
Fix:    dirs with () characters were not being processed by botscript.
New:    Homedir RESTRICTIONs now in place.  Homedirs will now become the user's 
	fake root.
	The homedir for users must be valid in order for users to successfully 
	login.  Users added by gadmins inherit their homedirs.
New:	ls -C and ls -F  added back in.
Fix:    Ident fix for mirc type users.  Thanks to the Eagle_1 and Eternal for 
	proving to me it was broke and especially for providing the fix.
Fix:    Timeout's fixed on transfers.  A timed out connection should also 
	no longer leave behind an incomplete file.
New:	Overwrite added to glftpd.conf's rights section.  
	See included glftpd.conf for example.  
	Its function is like that of "delete" where if the path/group match for
	the user, they'll be allowed to overwrite files.
Change: Overwriting of one's own files is now allowed by default, however, 
	stats are not updated after the upload.  The only exception are the 
	ANONYMOUS users who may not overwrite ANY files.
New:	Makedir added to glftpd.conf's rights section.
	See included glftpd.conf for example.  (NEEDED)
New:	Cmd line option -I in inetd.conf to disable ident.
Change: More detailed logging of purged users to sysop.log.
Change: SITE DELIP will accept multiple arguments in order to delete more
	than one ip from a user at a time. eg. SITE DELIP <USER> 1 3 5
Fix:	Directory listings on SAMBA mounted drives.
Fix:	PASSWD cmd now disabled for users flagged anonymous.

v1.15.8
Change: Stats no longer AUTO RESET themselves.  Running the RESET bin in
	crontab at midnight everyday now needed.  See UPGRADING text file.
	Expect certain scripts will need to be modified again.
	We'll try it like this for while and see if anyone complains. 
Fix:	DELETE was removing stats even in defined nostatdirs.
Fix:	Another and hopefully the last of the cache problems fixed.
Fix:	Added additional checks for users without ratios in order 
	to keep their credit statistics from varying.
Fix:	Userfile updates had the USER field still truncated down to 24
	characters.
Change: Purge: Moved the passwd entry removal before the userfile deletion.
New:	Collection of addon utilities written by Evilution included in the
	bin dir.
Change: All bins have been updated to comply with one another.
Fix:	Stats bin (Today) tops fixed.
New:	Reset bin has additional options added.  -h for Help
	Userfiles which fail to be reset will be announced through stdout.
New:	SITE USERS now recognizes: groups, private groups, leech, gadmin, siteop,
	nuke, unnuke, kick, kill, glock, exempt, useredit, undupe, take, give,
	and users as a filter.

v1.15.7
Fix:	User Cache bug.
Fix:	umask not cleared when writing to userfiles.
Fix:	Special owner/group assignments on userfiles being reset. (ie. 99)
Fix:	Unnuke function not logging the proper float value to glftpd.log
Fix:	Unfo changes not showing up immediately in 'site who'
Fix:	goodbye file not being created when a user is deleted.
Change: SITE UPDATE will now recreate the dirlog database in sorted order.
New:	%WHO cookie.
New:	External program (reset) for resetting user stats.  
	Designed to be run from crontab every night at midnight and is 
	made available just in case.  This program *should* never have to be
	used.  [ reset -h ] for available options.
Change: All external bins that update userfiles have been updated.
Change: The BSD version is now being compiled and tested on a 3.1-RELEASE 
	system.

v1.15.6
New:	New flag '8' for ANONYMOUS type users. 
	Restrictions placed on users flagged ANONYMOUS.
	1.  '!' on login is ignored.
	2.  They cannot DELETE, RMDIR, or RENAME. 
	3.  Userfiles do not update like usual, meaning no stats will
	    be kept for these users.  The userfile only serves as a template
	    for the starting environment of the logged in user. 
	    Use external scripts if you must keep records of their 
	    transfer stats.
Fix:	Bug in userfile parser that was introduced into 1.15.5.  Whoops!
	Those users who logged into a running 1.15.5 server with negative
	credits had their credits changed to some large number.
Change: Updates to userfiles now using a different approach.  
	This is in hopes of clearing an old problem of
	userfiles being truncated if a problem occurred during an update.
Fix: 	The well known file dupe bug is fixed.
New:	glupdate.c included in the bin dir.  Another cheesy addon utility
	for glftpd.  I'm surprised this old proggie sorta still works. 
	Its looking for a new home and someone who is willing to take care of it.
Fix:	External Nuker for BSD and possibly Solaris systems were inoperative.
	Needed an update to be compatible with ANONYMOUS type accounts.
New: 	New flag 'H' for the 'SITE USERS' command required.
New:	New environment variable added.  $HOST = IDENT@IP
Change: nostatdir was disabling credit subtraction on downloads when it shouldn't be.
	The freedldir variable in glftpd.conf should be the only determining factor
	concerning credits on downloads besides (ratio/creditcheck).
Fix:	CWD bug related to the use of dir_names fixed, and code improved upon.
	Those windows clients *should* be extremely satisfied now.

v1.15.5
Fix:	Rename rule added to disallow renaming over an existing file.
	Deletion of the old file beforehand is enforced.
Fix:	Negative credits wasn't being properly tested before a download.
Fix:	User CMD will now not allow you to change users if already logged in.
	Didn't work to begin with anyway.  

v1.15.4
New:	Dirlogscanner & nukelogscanner sources included.
Fix:	[:space:] use in glftpd.conf.
New:	grppath will now accept a (-) dash before the group names to signify
	that this group is not allowed access to the assigned directory.
	First directory/group match found in the order is used which makes
	this option best served if it is listed first.
	Example:
*	grppath  /bin	-GRP1
	will hide the bin dir from people in GRP1 only.
*	grppath  /bin	-GRP1 STAFF
	will allow only people in group STAFF access unless they are also in 
	group GRP1 in which case they will be denied.
New:	ignore_type config variable.   Will ignore the assigned file types from
	being recognized in the directory race info, nukes, unnukes, and dupes.	
	Example:
	ignore_type  *.[tT][xX][tT] *.[nN][fF][oO] [rR][eE][aA][dD][mM][eE] .message
	ignore_type  *.[sS][fF][vV] *.[cC][rR][cC] *.[dD][iI][zZ]

v1.15.3 
Change:	gadmin slots increased by one with each deluser for gadmins.
Fix:	site users <group>
Fix: 	time on today cookie.
Fix:	Code cleanup.
Fix:	group stats for different sections.

v1.15.2
New:	-B option for inetd.conf.
	Like the -b (port bouncer) option, the difference is this will only allow 
	connections to the ftp site by way of the bouncer.  Prevents the 
	display of the banner and login prompt if the user is not connecting 
	from a valid IP address.
	NOTE:  When using a bouncer you WILL need to run a tcp wrapper
	to only allow connections from the bouncer.
Change: ftp localhost (ie. 127.0.0.1) will allow the user to connect to the 
	site directly, thus bypassing ANY port bouncer options that may be enabled.
Fix:	Updates to userfiles wasn't always being detected properly by the cache.
Fix:	ls globbing.
Fix:	Site laston.
Change: help disabled at login
Change: ls -?  chucked.
Change: hardcoded filenames for /bin/dupescript & /bin/zipscript removed.
	USE..
	pre_check   /bin/dupescript
	post_check  /bin/zipscript
	#pre_check runs BEFORE the actual transfer begins..
	#post_check runs AFTER the file transfer..
	The paths to your script must be full and still be within the
	chroot. "rootpath". 	

v1.15.1
Change: New ls.  Contains most of the original external bin ls options.
	ls -? for help.
Change: grppaths now do EXACT fullpath matching now.  Now filenames/dirnames etc, can be
	similar.
Fix:	some of the admin functions were not parsing the command line properly.
Fix:	Input stream was not being closed before the file checking occurred.
Change: Gave those with USEREDIT rights the ability to use CHGRP.
Fix:	Logging of group changes fixed.
Fix:	Resuming uploads.
Change: EXEMPT user's are exempt from idle setting restrictions.
	They must now use 'site idle 0' if they wish to disable idle timeouts.

v1.15.0
Change: Useredit Program: Flags now can be modified.  No confirmation
	needed after changing an entry.  Some visual screen fixes.
Change: More (sysop.log) logging for group changes.
Change: passwd file preloaded/cached at startup.
Change: group file preloaded/cached at startup.
New:	Internal LS built in to take advantage of new caching features.
New:	Intelligent caching system for userfiles.
	Config variable "user_cache [1/0]" can be used to enable/disable
	it.  Default is enabled.
Fix:	Directory wildcard matching during CWD would hang the connection
	if the directory was non scannable.
Fix:	Minor nuke fixes.  
Fix:	Ignore_Noop, was still resetting the alarm counter.
Change: Exempt Users now (can) have to set their idle time to 0 after
	login to remain on site indefinitely.
Change: switched from using setenv() to putenv() to support the new
	Solaris Port.  
Change: When a new nuke matches that of a previous nuked directory, it is
	now totally removed from the system to prevent a rename error and the
	possibility of people renuking the same directory over again. 
Change: Daemon will allow the first line in the userfiles to be customized.
	Normally it would read, USER <username>.  Username can be anything
	and will remain untouched by the daemon.  50 Character limit.
New:	%[%s]IE  cookie made specifically for statline.txt.  
	Prints out the number of credits in a .1 float value or Unlimited.
Change: Byte totals in stats now displayed with commas.

v1.14.5
Fix:	pasv_addr - different compile optimization broke it.  Suspect pgcc is CRAP! 
Fix:	Cuteftp '!' bug fixed.
Fix:	Group login limits off by 1.
Fix:	Nuke/Unnuke wasn't updating user stats.. Ooops  
Fix:	Unnuke wasn't logging the full directory path.
Fix:	Missing /bin/dupescript from the dupe_check line in glftpd.conf now allowed.
Fix:	site stat crashing glftpd on FBSD if issued immediately upon login.
New:	User Editor binary included.
	
v1.14.4
New:	Optional "pasv_addr" variable for glftpd.conf.
	Determines what IP/Host is used for passive mode.
Fix:	IDLE time reporting was a tad inconsistent, to put it mildly.
	Guess you were right icetrain, it was the daemon.   :)
Fix:	Num_logins mistakenly incremented rather than login_times.  Oops.

v1.14.3
Fix:    Custom site commands would only accept up to a 30 character argument.
Fix:	Current directory information set incorrectly.  
Fix:	Stats broke when more than two stat_sections were defined.

v1.14.2
Fix:	site nfo. 
Fix:	total_users variable.
Fix:	Bug in the stat_section RETRIEVE function which caused FBSD daemons 
	to crash.

v1.14.1
Fix:	Stupid CuteFTP again.
Fix:	Some site who variables were being initially cleared.

v1.14.0
Added:  modified bftpd ftpghost utility for those who supposedly have
	ghost problems???  Source is in the bin dir.
New:	Optional "total_users" config variable.  Sets the total maximum number of
	users allowed on site.
New:    Optional "login_prompt" config variable added to customize your own
	initial login prompt.
New:	Optional "lslong" config variable added.  Standard wuftpd variable.
	Sets the default 'ls' command parameters.  Example:  lslong /bin/ls -lG
Change: SITE ADDIP now also accepts up to 5 ips on the command line.
New:	Multiple STATS & or CREDITS (by directory) supported.
	*REQUIRED*  'stat_section  DEFAULT   *   yes'  must be in glftpd.conf
	for current glftpd sites regardless of whether you use or need multiple 
	stats. See DOCS for needed configurations for use with multiple stats. 
	Due to userfile size limitations and what not, up to ten separate 
	sections may only be defined. 
	Site users, site give, site take, site ginfo, all stats, ALL show
	relevant information depending on what the current directory is.
New:	SITE STATS, SITE STATS <user> 
	Displays 'user.stats' of all sections.
	Additional stats are appended onto the display and read in their own
	text file to gather display format.  
	eg. A stat_section with a keyword of ISO would read from ISOuser.stats.
New:	SITE SHOW <user>, for SITEOPS.  Displays a user's userfile in raw form 
	to be used in troubleshooting and outside scripts.
New:	Optional inetd.conf parameter added:  -n <num>
	Set the number for dns retries.  0 disables dns resolving all together.
Change: call to zipscript totally rewritten.  Stdout from zipscript now
	lreply'd.  Use of color cookies within zipscript possible.
Change: call to dupescript rewritten as well.  Stdout IS ALLOWED.
Change: SITE GROUP split.  Listing of available groups now done with a new
	site command of SITE GROUPS.
Change: flags allowed changed back to A - Z, a - z, 1 - 9.  For the benefit
	of external scripts again.
Change: pid/online file routines rewritten and now taking advantage of shared memory.
Fix:	Few Online cookies fixed.
Fix:	Requested security fix for bouncer by Eagle_1 put into place. 
Fix:	GPWD showing gpwk header.
Fix:	Bug in changing user flags.
Fix:	DEL & RMDIR modified to work with (dir_names / file_names) configs.
Fix:	site delip user 0 fixed.

v1.13.6
Fix:	Long standing random uid bug that showed up under certain
	circumstances fixed.  Should fix those [UNKNOWN] nuke announcements.
New:	Bandwidth controls on users (downloads only)
	SITE CHANGE <USER> max_speed <BYTES/SEC>
	0 = Unlimited. <Default>
New:	%[%f]Iz User cookie added for max_speed.
Fix:	creditdir on deletes wasn't working.   
New:	DUPE_CHECK_DAYS in glftpd.conf changed to just DUPE_CHECK and reads
	in an additional parameter.  A path to an external script may be 
	specified which will be ran before a file is actually transferred.
	Exit status of 1 denies upload, 0 allows it to continue.
	Simple dupescript included as sample.
Change: nodupechk, nostatdir, creditdir, freedldir all moved over to using
	the same wildcard matching scheme that was implemented in 1.13.4.
	Add the /* at the end of your paths if you need them.
Change: ! & " characters now not allowed when using 'site unfo'
Change: dirlog updates modified to show total files/bytes for all files directly
	below it including all those within subdirs.
	This should benefit ISO sites mostly due to the majority of their
	releases containing subdirs of CD volumes.
Fix:	Changing the DELETED flag via the 'site change <user> flags' command 
	wasn't properly setting the ownership of the userfile.  Only deluser/
	readd will be allowed to modify this flag from now on.
New:	ignore_noop in glftpd.conf.  Usual [1/0] On/Off usage.
	Ignores the NOOP command and keeps that idle time ticking.. :)
Fix:	Abort fix on Downloads.
	 
v1.13.5
Change: SITE NEW, SITE NUKES, and SITE UNNUKES rewritten.
	100% speed improvement from earlier versions.

v1.13.4 
Change: glftpd.conf now will accept [:space:] anywhere and will translate
	it into a space.  Default_tagline, sitename_long, private group
	descriptions will most likely need this.
	This also makes it possible to specify arguments on the command line
	of your custom site cmds.
Change: New wildcard matching scheme employed.  Directory wildcard matching
	is as it should be finally.  Is now able to limit new directory
	announcements, nukes, etc,, to a specific directory.
	See sample glftpd.conf for some great samples and explanations.
Change: Force_Tagline and Default_Tagline in glftpd have been combined.
	See sample glftpd.conf file.
Change: SITE SEARCH does it matching like that of site dupe. 
	(Wildcards not used)
New:	Gadmins can be assigned their own default.<group> userfiles
	as templates to be used when they add a user.
	Defaults to the default.user file if none is found.
	Suggest chown 99.99 all default.* files to keep them out of the
	displays.
Change: SITE USERS now accepts a GROUP NAME along with DELETED,
	SITEOP, GADMIN, and LEECH in its lists of optional arguments.
	SITE LGRP seems obsolete now and has been removed.
Fix:	With the port bouncer enabled certain fxp clients were unable
	to transfer files through the bounce.  Broke in 1.13.3 with 
	the stupid security enhancements that were put into place.  

v1.13.3 
New:	DOC file included.  Supplied & maintained by icetrain.
New:	SITE GRPLOG now has a build in help display showing the current
	group login restrictions.
New:	PGROUP environment variable (Just the 1st private group of user)
Fix:	Dirlogscanner broke with the new userfile format.  Also in add-ons.
Fix:	More security enhancements made when the port_bouncer is in use.
Fix:	RMD associated with the delete right in glftpd.conf now.
Fix:	RENAME, & DELETE by default now only allow those who own the file/dir to
	rename or delete unless they have the NUKE flag set.
	If the rename or delete right is set to yes in the rights section of
	glftpd.conf, anyone will be allowed to rename or delete another's
	file/dir.  Samples included with the packaged glftpd.conf for better
	clarification.
Fix:	A check for invalid flag values put into the SITE CHANGE function.
	Invalid flag values won't be written out to the userfile.
Fix:	SITE UNFO broke.  Thanks to Devestato for tracking down
	the creation of those strange files in the users dir.
New:	FILE_NAMES in glftpd.conf has the caps_first_letter option.
	Same setup as DIR_NAMES below it.
New:	%= COOKIE,  SAMPLE: %=123/dir/file  '123' are flag values.  
	If the user has any one of them set then the specified file is 
	displayed.  NOTE: the path must begin with a '/' 
	See the site.help file for more samples.
New:	USEREDIT flag added.  Basically a GADMIN for any group on site, 
	and given limited access to some of the 'site change' commands. 
Fix:	GRPPATHs slightly modified and is now accurate.  Use spaces or tabs
	to separate groups/users instead of commas from now on.
Fix:	Private groups not showing up in the 'site chgrp user' listing.
Change  Private groups now shown on the 'site group' listings.

v1.13.2
New:    New install text files thanks to Fenris.
Fix:	The group ids popping up instead of names when comments are 
	included in the group file.
New:	Date Created Cookie for the 'SITE USER' display.  See README.COOKIES
Fix:	Changing flags for users who are currently online.
	This should also take of those strange named userfiles showing up
	in the users directory.
Change: Flag of KILL allows the user to use SITE SWHO
Fix:	SITEOPS can now kick themselves.. :)
Fix:	Some colors displayed in SITE GROUP was crashing the daemon on FBSD.
 
v1.13.1
Fix:	SITE WHO displaying the same user/group/unfo information.
Change: ftpwho.c (pidfile struct) has tagline added.
Fix:	%! was removed in 1.13.0.
New:	STATS bin - UNTESTED
	Also does not require SUID ROOT anymore!   Just needs read
	access to the userfiles and glftpd.conf.
New: 	glconvert bin to convert from the old < 1.13.0 versions.
	This does not set the flags of users on the site, so all siteops,
	nukers, and gadmins will need to have their accounts modified 
	afterwards.  BACK-UP all userfiles before using.
	Usage:  copy to the users directory and run.
New:	New ftpwho source available with the new struct defined.

v1.13.0
Change: TOTAL rewrite of the loading and updating of userfiles.
	Should get rid of the old LOCK.ERR problem as well as ALOT of
	the unnecessary disk io's.  Userfile structure regrettably has to 
	change to become more efficient.

	setting. 
Change: Wildcards now used in 'SITE UNDUPE'

	1st line will allow anyone (* = all groups) to upload anywhere on the site.

		incoming, but will allow people to create directories there and 
		upload into them.
	This should get rid of those stray files appearing under the dated dirs.

	who were without a group relationship.

	files while they are being uploaded.
Change: Most of the ONLINE user structure was rewritten and cleaned in hopes
	of fixing a sporadic problem of people being able to connect to the site
	more times than they are allowed.  FEEDBACK on whether this is a fix or not
	is welcomed.

	for external admin utility, siteop.
